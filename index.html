            <h2>TEN AVATARS OF LORD VISHNU</h2>
            <span>God Of The Universe</span>
            <p>Vishnu is among the most important deities of Hinduism. Together with Brahma and Shiva, 
                Vishnu forms the principal trinity of Hindu religious practice. 

                In his many forms, Vishnu is regarded as the preserver and protector.
                 Hinduism teaches that when humanity is threatened by chaos or evil,
                  Vishnu will descend into the world in one of his incarnations to restore righteousness. </p>

                <p>Matsya is said to have forewarned people about a coming flood and ordered them to preserve all the grains and

                <P>Kurma (or Koorma) is the tortoise incarnation that relates to the myth of churning the ocean to obtain treasures dissolved in the ocean of milk. In this myth, Vishnu took the form of

                <P>As the legend goes, the demon Hiranyakashipiu obtained a boon from Brahma that he could not be killed or harmed by any means.
                     Now arrogant in his security, Hiranyakshipiu began to cause trouble both in heaven and on Earth. </P>
                <p>However, his son Prahlada was devoted to Vishnu. One day, when the demon challenged Prahlada, Vishnu emerged in the form of a man-lion known as
                     Narasimha to slay the demon. </p>

                <P>In the Rig Veda, Vamana (the dwarf) appears when the demon king Bali ruled the 
                    universe and the gods lost their power. One day, Vamana visited the court of Bali and begged for as much land as he could cover in three steps. Laughing at the dwarf, Bali granted the wish.

            <P>In his form as Parasurama, Vishnu appears as a priest (Brahman) who comes to the world to kill bad kings and protect humanity from danger. He appears in the form of a man carrying an ax, sometimes referred to as Rama with an axe.</P>
